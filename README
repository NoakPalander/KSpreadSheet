# KSpreadSheet

KSpreadSheet is a google spreadsheet tool able to append data to a google spreadsheet using the Google API and Kotlin language.

The `Lib` folder contains the source code and the java-library project which is used within the `Example` folder. Both featuring [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) using the [gradle](https://gradle.org/) build system.

KSpreadSheet also showcases editing the cell style for the spreadsheet document using the Google API format. In the case of `Example`, it's loaded via a [json](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) file from the `Example/src/main/resources` directory.
